1. Overall Survival Rate

Insight: Baseline survival rate established

Patterns:

Only ~38% passengers survived (342/891)

Binary outcome shows clear disparity

Action: Compare against subgroup survival rates

2. Survival by Gender

Key Findings:

74% female survival vs 19% male survival

Gender was the strongest predictor of survival

Notable Exception:

3rd class women had lower survival than 1st/2nd class men

3. Survival by Passenger Class

Clear Gradient:

1st class: 62% survived

2nd class: 47% survived

3rd class: 25% survived

Shocking Contrast:

1st class survival > 2x 3rd class

4. Age Distribution

Demographic Insights:

Peak ages: 20-30 years (typical working age)

Secondary peak: 0-5 (children)

Right-skewed distribution (few elderly passengers)

Survival Correlation:

Children (<10) had higher survival rates

20-30 group showed typical survival patterns

5. Class-Gender-Survival Intersection

Most Protected Group:

1st class women: 79% survival

Most Vulnerable Group:

3rd class men: 13% survival

Policy Implications:

"Women and children first" strongly enforced for 1st/2nd class

3rd class passengers faced systemic disadvantages

Summary of Key Patterns:
Strongest Predictors: Gender > Class > Age

Intersectionality Matters: 3rd class women fared worse than 1st class men

Data Quality Note: Age had ~20% missing values (median imputation used)
